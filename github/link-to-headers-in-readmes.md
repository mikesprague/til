# Link to Headers in READMEs

Anytime you add a header to a markdown file, GitHub attaches an `href` with
it's downcased name. For example, "JavaScript" receives a link to
`#javascript`.

Leverage this by adding a table of contents to your README with links to the
headers further down the document:

```markdown
### Table of Contents

- [GitHub](#github)
```

This will link to a header containing 'GitHub'.
