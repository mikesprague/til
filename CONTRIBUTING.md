## Writing a good a TIL

TIL's should be a focused and concise piece of knowledge that's 
interesting and worth sharing with others.

Here's some guidelines on how to write a great TIL:

* Avoid writing more than 60 lines of content.
* Avoid writing more than 2 examples.
* Avoid going into too much detail.

If you find your TIL straying from these guidelines consider narrowing 
the scope of it or writing a blog post on the subject.
