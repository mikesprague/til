The following takes the best parts of several resources I found on git commit
messages while researching the ideal git commit.

**The Layout**

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**The Title (the first line)**

The title consists of the `<type>` and the `<subject>`

> Protip: Find yourself with an *and* in that commit title?  Consider breaking
> the commit down.  `git commit -p` is your friend!
> http://blog.tplus1.com/blog/2008/10/31/break-up-changes-into-different-commits-with-git-add-p/

**Allowed Values for `<type>`**

- :package: **feature** (new feature)
- :bug: **fix** (bug fix)
- :book: **docs** (changes to documentation)
- :art: **style** (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
- :fire: **refactor** (refactoring production code)
- :no_entry: **remove** (remove code and/or files)
- :white_check_mark: **test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests;
  no production code change)
- :wrench: **chore** (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- :eyeglasses: **linting** (remove linter warnings/errors; no breaking code changes)


**Subject**

Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary. Use imperative tone to convey
what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use **change**,
not *changed* or *changes*


**The Body**

```
More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative (same as Subject).  This
convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like
git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```

**The Footer**

Here you can reference issues and pull-requests that relate to your commit, like so:

```
closes #125
```
